### Other options

By default, all user email domains are allowed to authenticate through Google.
If you want to limit the user email domains allowed to use the plugin, list one per line in the  "Allowed domains" text box.

For example:

```text
onedomain.com
otherdomain.com
```

With the above configuration, only users with email addresses on the domains "onedomain.com" and "otherdomain.com" will be allowed to acccess your Redmine instance using Google OAuth.

### Authentication Workflow

1. An unauthenticated user requests the URL to your Redmine instance.
2. User clicks the "Login via Google" buton.
3. The plugin redirects them to a Google sign in page if they are not already signed in to their Google account.
4. Google redirects user back to Redmine, where the Google OAuth plugin's controller takes over.

One of the following cases will occur:
1. If self-registration is enabled (Under Administration > Settings > Authentication), user is redirected to 'my/page'
2. Otherwse, the an account is created for the user (referencing their Google OAuth2 ID). A Redmine administrator must activate the account for it to work.
